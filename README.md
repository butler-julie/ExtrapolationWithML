# Extrapolating Physics Data Using Machine Learning Algorithms

Repository is currently under construction.  All codes contained within should work but currently adding comments and documentation in addition to additional files.  Organization of repository is likely to change.

## UNDER CONSTRUCTION
* For an explanation of the codes pertaining to regression algorithms see [this file](Regression/RegressionCodes.md)
* For an explanation of the codes pertaining to recurrent neural networks algorithms see [this file](RecurrentNeuralNetworks/RecurrentNeuralNetworkCodes.md)
