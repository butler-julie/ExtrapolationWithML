By: James Shepherd

While this paper does not explicitly involve extrapolation using machine learning, it is the inspiration for one of the projects contained in this repository.  James Shepherd shows an extrapolation using traditional methods for the correlations energies of an electron gas collected using couple cluster theory.  The extrapolation is to an infinite number of orbitals first, and then to an infinite number of particles, resulting in the correlation energy at the thermodynamic limit.  The data set provided in this repository does display finite size effects, due to the fact the number of particles and the number of orbitals have to be truncated to some finite number.  Shepherd proposes a rescaling of the x axis which should mitigate these finite size effects, though this reformatting does not matter when the sequential formatting is used.  The idea behind this project is to perform the extrapolation on the same data set used in the Shepherd paper, but using machine learning instead of traditional extrapolation methods.
